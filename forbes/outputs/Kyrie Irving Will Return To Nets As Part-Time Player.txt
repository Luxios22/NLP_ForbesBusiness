Brooklyn Nets point guard Kyrie Irving, who has yet to play a game for his team this season due to his refusal to be vaccinated against Covid-19, will return to the Nets on a part-time basis, playing exclusively in away games in order to comply with local vaccine mandates, General Manager Sean Marks said Friday.

Most notably absent was All-Star guard James Harden, who entered health and safety protocols an hour before the game’s tipoff. Should he return, Irving would bring off-the-dribble creation the team is lacking without Harden.
