Palmer, who pleaded guilty in October, threw a fire extinguisher, a long pole and a plank at officers outside the Capitol Building.After his plea agreement, while being held in a D.C. jail, Palmer lied on an online fundraising plea that he did “go on the defense” when throwing the fire extinguisher at police in retaliation for being shot with rubber bullets and tear gas.Palmer later admitted he was not shot prior to attacking the officers, and U.S. District Judge Tanya S. Chutkan deemed this lie a sign he had not taken responsibility for his actions.Palmer’s plea agreement had called for a sentence in the range of 46 to 57 months, but Chutkan extended it to a  range of 63 to 78 months due to his lying, ultimately landing on a 63-month term.  “The people working in the Capitol that night, they are patriots,” Chutkan said to Palmer in the courtroom. “Doing what they get paid to do, they didn’t know if they were going to come out of there alive that night.”220. That’s how many people have been charged with assaulting or impeding law enforcement during the January 6 riot, with more than 700 arrested.
