Baltimore Ravens quarterback Lamar Jackson is inactive for today's game against the Green Bay  Packers.Christmas might have come a week early for the Green Bay Packers.Baltimore star quarterback Lamar Jackson is inactive and won’t play against the Packers today. This will mark the first start Jackson has missed in his four-year NFL career.Jackson suffered a bone bruise in his ankle last week during a 24-22 loss to Cleveland.Baltimore will start second-year quarterback Tyler Huntley.Huntley replaced Jackson early against the Browns last week. And after a rough start, Huntley completed 27 of 38 passes for 270 yards and a touchdown. He also ran for 45 yards on six carries and nearly rallied the Ravens to victory.“I mean you prepare for both guys,” Packers head coach Matt LaFleur said Friday. “But you know, when you look at their scheme, they don't deviate a whole lot. They have a very similar skill set in Lamar and Huntley and you’ve got to be ready for both those guys.”Still Huntley is no Jackson.Jackson has a 37-12 career record (.755) and is equally dangerous with his arm and feet.Jackson won the NFL’s MVP in 2019, a year in which he threw for 3,127 yards and 26 touchdowns and ran for 1,206 yards and seven scores. In his brief career, he’s thrown for nearly 10,000 yards and 84 touchdowns and rushed for 3,673 yards and 21 touchdowns.“Lamar obviously has been doing it longer and he’s played at a very, very high level,” LaFleur said. “He’s always a guy that it’s tough to replace that experience. “But I think Huntley when he’s been in there this year he’s done a heck of a job. So, either way our defense is going to have their work cut out for ‘em. We’re going to have to do a great job stopping the run. This is the No. 1 rushing offense in the National Football League. So it’s going to be a good challenge either way.”
