Green Bay Packers head coach Matt LaFleur has led his team to three straight NFC North titles.It was just step one toward many bigger goals.But man, what a step it was.The Green Bay Packers won their eighth NFC North title in 11 years Sunday thanks to their 31-30 victory over Baltimore. The Packers improved to 11-3, hold the NFC’s No. 1 seed and built an insurmountable 4 ½-game lead over second place Minnesota.The last time a divisional team dominated like this came a half century ago when Bud Grant’s Minnesota Vikings won 10 of 11 titles inside the old NFC Central. The Vikings won four straight divisional crowns between 1968-71, then after the Packers won the division in 1972, Minnesota ripped off six straight NFC Central titles from 1973-78.Today, the Packers rule the division like no one since those Purple People Eaters.“It just means it’s a step in the right direction,” linebacker De’Vandre Campbell said of winning the division. “We’ve got bigger aspirations than just winning our division, but it’s definitely a step in the right direction. I’m going to enjoy this moment.”Packers safety Adrian Amos agreed.“The locker room, everybody is happy that we accomplished our first goal, because our first goal was always winning the North,” Amos said. “Now it’s time to keep working and keep building and stacking games and building that momentum going into the playoffs.”The Packers have certainly had a remarkable amount of momentum inside the division since the 2011 season.Mike McCarthy led the Packers to four straight divisional titles between 2011-14, and after Minnesota won it 2015, Green Bay captured the North again in 2016. The Packers were a sub-.500 team in both 2017-18 and fired McCarthy. Matt LaFleur was hired in 2019 and has led Green Bay to three straight NFC North titles since.In that time, Green Bay is 45-17-2 against its foes from the North, an impressive .719 winning percentage. The Packers were 30-16-2 against the division from 2011-18 (.646), and have gone an incredible 14-2 inside the division under LaFleur (.875).Since the NFC Central/North was established in 1967, few have dominated like Green Bay the past 11 years.Minnesota’s ruled the division in the 1970s. Then in 1977, Tampa Bay joined Green Bay, Minnesota, Chicago and Detroit in what was known as the ‘Black and Blue’ division.Mike Ditka’s Chicago Bears won five straight NFC Central titles from 1984-88 and six of seven overall. But after capturing the Central in 1990, the Bears went 11 years before winning the division again.Green Bay won three straight NFC Central titles between 1995-97. Then after the 2001 season, the NFL went to eight four-team divisions and Tampa Bay was moved to the NFC South.The Central was renamed the North and Green Bay immediately made its mark. The Packers won three straight divisional titles between 2002-04 and four in six years overall.But nothing in almost 50 years has matched what these current Packers are up to.Minnesota, thanks to its dominance under Grant, still has the most divisional titles since 1967 with 20. The Packers’ recent run has pushed their total to 17, followed by Chicago (11), Tampa Bay (3) and Detroit (3).“Well, that is always the first goal is you have to win your division,” LaFleur said. “That guarantees you a home playoff game and it really gets you in the dance, and that’s ultimately what you’d like to do. I think it’s fair to say that the ultimate goal is everybody has the same ultimate goal, and that’s to be the last team standing at the end of the year. And until we do that, I don’t think we’ll be satisfied.”That’s certainly understandable.But Green Bay’s dominance of the North since 2011 is something it should be incredibly satisfied with.
