Health authorities in New Zealand on Monday said that a 26-year-old man’s death may be linked to a rare side effect of the Pfizer vaccine, a finding that does not however alter the authorities' view that the benefits of the shot far outweigh any rare side effects.Myocarditis is one of the rare side effects linked to mRNA vaccines, like the one made by  Pfizer-BioNTech.The 26-year-old died within two weeks of receiving the vaccine and preliminary post mortem reports indicated that myocarditis—a dangerous inflammation of the heart muscle—was the likely cause of death.In a statement, New Zealand’s Covid-19 Vaccine Independent Safety Monitoring Board (CVISMB) said, based on available data, it considered that the person’s myocarditis was probably caused by the vaccination.The person in question had not sought any medical advice or treatment for the symptoms, the board found.The board also noted that Myocarditis was a treatable condition if identified, with earlier treatment offering better outcomes.The monitoring group noted that the risk of myocarditis from Covid-19 was significantly higher than from the Pfizer vaccine and added that the benefits of vaccinations continue to far outweigh any risks from rare side effects.Pfizer told Reuters that it was aware of the death in New Zealand but it continues to believe that the “benefit-risk profile for its vaccine was positive.” In August, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) calculated that Covid-19 increased the risk of myocarditis almost 16-fold, with the highest risk increases among those under 16 years old (36.8%) and over 75 (31.6%).Besides the 26-year-old’s case, the CVISMB also examined the deaths of a 13-year-old child and a man in his 60s, also possibly linked to vaccines. The board said it needs further information from the coroner before determining if the vaccine played a role in the teenager’s death. In the case of the man in the 60s—who also died from myocarditis—the board said his heart condition was unlikely to be related to vaccinations. It added that the time from vaccination to the onset of symptoms and clinical factors point to other causes in the older man.90%. That’s the percentage of New Zealand’s eligible population—people over the age of 12—who have been fully vaccinated against Covid-19, according to official government data. So far authorities in the country have linked vaccines as the probable cause in two deaths out of nearly 4 million people who have received at least one vaccine dose.In August, the New Zealand health ministry reported that an unnamed woman had died due to myocarditis likely linked to the Pfizer vaccine. At the time, the country’s Director-General of Health Ashley Bloomfield also noted that the benefits of vaccination still heavily outweighed any risks. The U.S. CDC has also issued similar guidance, noting that elevated risk of myocarditis has been observed in mRNA vaccine recipients—particularly males aged between 12 and 29 years—but such incidents were very rare.New Zealand links 26-year-old man's death to Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine (Reuters)Man's death likely from myocarditis reaction to Covid-19 vaccine - safety board (Radio New Zealand)Full coverage and live updates on the Coronavirus
