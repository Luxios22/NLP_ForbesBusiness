'Bleach Thousand Year Blood War' is the final story arc from the manga.The final arc of the Bleach manga by Tite Kubo, known as the Thousand Year Blood War, will be getting a new anime series next year.The Bleach manga started back in 2001 and was adapted into an anime series in 2004. The anime series finished back in 2014 with a monumental 366 episodes. There were also a total of four films and two OVAs, so Bleach’s anime was extensive if nothing else.However, the final arc of the manga, comprising of volumes 55 to 74, has not been adapted until now. This is because while the anime finished back in 2014, the manga finished two years later in 2016.This means that Thousand Year Blood War was obviously omitted from the original anime adaptation but will finally be getting the anime treatment after all these years.The latest trailer (shown below) does also look very promising though, and it almost looks like film quality in a few places. Considering how popular Bleach has been, it will be interesting to see how Thousand Year Blood War does. If the original Bleach anime is anything to go by, then there will be a bunch of games released for this new series in the not-too-distant future.Talking of games, it’s also worth pointing out that Tite Kubo also penned the character designs for the recent Sakura Wars game back in 2019.Bleach Thousand Year Blood War will air on Japanese television in October of next year. VIZ Media has secured the worldwide rights to the anime as well, so will be bringing it Westward accordingly.Follow me on Twitter, Facebook and YouTube.
