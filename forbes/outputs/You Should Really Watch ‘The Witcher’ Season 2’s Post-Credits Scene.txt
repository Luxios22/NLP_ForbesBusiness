The Witcher Season 2 has a post-credits trailer for its upcoming prequel show, 'The Witcher: Blood  Origins.'I assume that many of you probably missed the fact that there was a secret, post-credits scene at the end of Netflix’s The Witcher Season 2. I certainly did.Like the post-credits “scene” in Spider-Man: No Way Home, it’s not really a scene at all, but rather a trailer. Spider-Man’s trailer was for Dr. Strange And The Multiverse Of Madness; The Witcher’s trailer is for its prequel spinoff, The Witcher: Blood Origins.Blood Origins takes place over a thousand years before the events of Geralt, Ciri and Yennefer’s adventures, and details the events that lead up to the “Conjunction of the Spheres.” This is when humans and monsters flooded onto the Continent.We hear a lot about this magical collision of worlds in Season 2 of The Witcher. In Blood Origins, we’ll see how it all goes down.Before the Conjunction, the world was inhabited by the Elves and Dwarves. In fact, Gnomes were the first known race to inhabit the Continent. Dwarves came next and then Elves—who arrived about a thousand years prior to humans and the Conjunction.In any case, here’s the trailer/post-credits scene:Michelle Yeoh leads the show’s cast as Scian, the last member of a nomadic tribe of sword-elves on a quest to retrieve a sacred blade.Sophia Brown plays Éile, a warrior of the Queen’s Guard who abandons that life to become a bard.Laurence O’Fuarain plays Fjall, an elf warrior out for vengeance.The Witcher: Blood Origins is slated for a 2022 release and will be comprised of six episodes and just one season.I’ll be publishing my review of The Witcher Season 2 in the very near future, so stay tuned to this blog and follow me at the links below.
