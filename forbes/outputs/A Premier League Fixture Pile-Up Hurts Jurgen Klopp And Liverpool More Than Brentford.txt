Maybe at one specific point it's not in our hands anymore and somebody else would stop the league then it would be like this.”Not that the Liverpool coach was enamoured with the idea of continuing to play with ever more players side-lined by the virus. "The other thing is we just play on, which is really difficult – pretty much impossible because we have now not only smaller squads because step by step players will get infected, that's how it looks in the moment, and hopefully we can break the chain somehow, but it's not unlikely that it will happen,” he added.It didn’t take long for the Liverpool coach to use the current crisis to complain about one of his favourite bugbears; English soccer’s busy winter schedule."With reduced squads, smaller squads, you cannot play that schedule. Can you play on? Yes. Can you use youth players, academy players? Yes. Can you play then every three days? No."That's the thing, even when you stay healthy it's already tough, but when you are not complete then it's really tough, or it's impossible and that's the thing.”BLACKPOOL, ENGLAND - DECEMBER 18: Fans arriving at Bloomfield Road make their way through Covid 19  Passport Check Points during the Sky Bet Championship match between Blackpool and Peterborough United at Bloomfield Road on December 18, 2021 in Blackpool, England.

The Liverpool boss sarcastically congratulated Kelly on James Milner being injured in a game which had been rescheduled to 12:30 on a Saturday television slot.Thomas Frank and Brentford have fewer concerns when it comes to availability, other than the odd Carabao Cup game or midweek Premier League clash, they have time to slot in rearranged games.A far more damaging prospect is losing to rivals because key players are missing. If this can be avoided with a postponement that could be the difference in securing precious points for survival.Frank looks to be getting his way so far, and with cases of the Omicron variant of Covid-19 going through the roof in the UK it’s an issue that won’t be going away any time soon.
