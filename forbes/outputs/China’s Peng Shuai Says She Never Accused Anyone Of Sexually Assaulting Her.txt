Chinese tennis star Peng Shuai on Sunday said she never claimed that anyone sexually assaulted her, a statement which appears to be a retraction of her earlier account of sexual coercion by a former Chinese vice premier amid concerns that she was being pressured to deny her initial claims.Chinese tennis player Peng Shuai previously accused the country's former vice premier of sexually  coercion.In an interview with Singaporean news outlet Lianhe Zaobao, Peng said she wanted to stress that she “never said or wrote” that anyone sexually assaulted her and noted that her previous social media post had been misunderstood.Peng also said she has “always been free,” denying reports that she was being closely monitored by Chinese authorities and forced to make statements against will.The 35-year-old also added that the takedown of her original social media post on Chinese social media platform Weibo was a “private matter.”Peng’s remarks are the first time she has spoken about the allegations on camera in public and they were made on the sidelines of a cross-country skiing event in Shanghai.Yaqiu Wang, a senior China researcher at Human Rights Watch, tweeted: “So, after 48 days, Peng Shuai unexpectedly encountered a journalist from a pro-Beijing newspaper and then casually answered her questions about an event that garnered intense international attention. Wow, so natural, very real, everyone now believes it. Congratulations, the CCP!”The Women’s Tennis Association (WTA), which moved to suspend all events in China earlier this month due to concerns over the treatment of Peng, told Reuters that it was “good to see” Peng in a public setting but added: “As we have consistently stated, these appearances do not alleviate or address the WTA’s significant concerns about her well-being and ability to communicate without censorship or coercion. We remain steadfast in our call for a full, fair and transparent investigation, without censorship, into her allegation of sexual assault.”Last week, Chinese state-run broadcaster CGTN tweeted what it claimed was the text on an email that Peng had sent to the Women’s Tennis Association’s chief executive Steve Simon. In the purported email, Peng denies the sexual assault allegations, along with reports that she is missing or unsafe. The email also calls on the tennis organization to seek her consent before releasing any news about her after first verifying it with her. However, the WTA chief and several other activists had raised questions about the authenticity of the email. In her interview on Sunday, Peng said she had written the email to Simon in Chinese and the English translation of it published on CGTN was accurate.Last month, the 35-year-old tennis star accused former Chinese vice premier Zhang Gaoli of forcing her to have sex with him. The accusation was made in a post on the Chinese social media platform Weibo, but the post was quickly taken down, reportedly by China’s web censors. Peng’s statement was the first time that a sexual misconduct allegation was made against a senior member of the Chinese Communist Party. Despite Beijing’s silence on the issue, key sporting figures quickly moved to express their support for Peng. Expressing concerns about the treatment of the tennis player, the WTA announced earlier this month that it would suspend all of its tournaments in China.Chinese tennis star Peng denies she made accusation of sexual assault (Reuters)Chinese Tennis Player Denies Sexual Abuse Claim, Raising More Questions (New York Times)
