Much of the media and political world reacted with shock Sunday when longtime Fox News Sunday host Chris Wallace announced he was leaving the Fox News network for a new program on CNN+, but conservatives on Facebook took the news as a reason to rejoice, after long criticizing the anchor as out of step at the right-leaning network.Moderator Chris Wallace asks for quiet from the audience during the final presidential debate at the  Thomas and Mack Center on the campus of the University of Las Vegas in Las Vegas on October 19, 2016.Two of the top four most liked and shared link posts on Facebook this week came from conservative commentator Ben Shapiro, who shared stories from his website, the Daily Wire, about Wallace’s departure.One of those posts shared a story of reactions to Wallace’s departure with a headline saying in part, “Good Riddance To This Fraud,” to which Shapiro commented: “If you’re Chris Wallace, this has got to hurt.”A post from the conservative website the Daily Caller about Wallace also came in as the 11th most popular link post on Facebook this week, according to data compiled by the social media tracking firm CrowdTangle.The posts from Shapiro, which ranked No. 3 and No. 4 as the most popular link posts, combined for more than 270,000 likes and reactions, over 78,000 comments and nearly 10,000 shares.Wallace has a strong reputation among fellow journalists for his straightforward reporting style and tough interview questions, an approach that caused tensions with former President Donald Trump and left Wallace politically alienated from other personalities at the network given the increasingly hard-right stances of Fox News show hosts. Anonymous sources told NPR last month that Wallace was unhappy that Fox allowed prime time show host Tucker Carlson to produce a special called Patriot Purge that spread conspiracy theories about the January 6 storming of the U.S. Capitol, which was carried out by Trump supporters. Wallace said at the conclusion of this week’s Fox News Sunday that he was leaving the network after 18 years because he’s “ready for a new adventure” and he plans “to try something new, to go beyond politics” on his upcoming CNN+ show. The CNN+ streaming service is expected to launch in early 2022.The top link post on Facebook this week wasn’t directly political, which is a rarity as of late, but did come from conservative pastor Franklin Graham, who posted a story about the deadly tornado outbreak across the upper South and Midwest.Chris Wallace Leaves Fox News After 18 Years—And Joins CNN+ (Forbes)Donald Trump Asks 'Why Does Fox News Keep Chris Wallace?'
