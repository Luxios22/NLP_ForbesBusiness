  have come to an arrangement to restore ABC, National Geographic, ESPN and other Disney channels to Youtube TV after a two-day blackout due to a disagreement over carriage fees.After an agreement had been reached between the two entities on Sunday YouTube promptly released a statement.“We have already started to restore access to Disney networks like ESPN and FX, including their live and on-demand content, as well as any recordings that were previously in your [DVR] Library,”“We will also be turning on the local ABC stations over the course of the day.”“As we promised a $15 discount while the Disney content remained off platform, we will still honor a one-time credit for all impacted Base Plan members.” The specific terms of the deal were not disclosed however YouTube cautioned last week that an agreement would only be reached on “equitable terms”. As the deal expired at midnight ET on December 17th, YouTube’s pulling of all of Disney’s networks resulted in customers losing any DVR recording they may have made and saved. PHILADELPHIA, PA - DECEMBER 20: ESPN analyst Stephen A.

Coupled with Disney’s vast array of networks and high-end content, both sides were incentivized to close a deal.
