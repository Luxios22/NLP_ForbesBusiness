Rollins is one of a constellation of former Phillie stars on the 2022 Hall of Fame ballot, along with Curt Schilling, Bobby Abreu, Ryan Howard, Scott Rolen and Jonathan Papelbon. The next HOF class will be announced on Jan. 25. Schilling, who’s on the ballot for the 10th and final time, deserves strong consideration. And, yes, so does Rollins. A slew of scribes are digging into the analytics to prove J-Roll’s case for Cooperstown. But you don’t have to dig too deep. Just look at Rollins’ career home runs (231) and stolen bases (470), and you’ll realize how HOF-worthy he is. Sink your baseball brain into this: Rollins is the only shortstop in the history of the game to reach at least 200 HRs and 400 SBs. Not Ernie Banks, not Robin Yount, not Derek Jeter — yep, no other shortstop has ever hit those two milestones. And the game only dates back to the start of the second Industrial Revolution. Rollins finished with 33 more homers and 91 more stolen bases than Barry Larkin (and also had more Gold Gloves), and J-Roll absolutely crushes Alan Trammell in HRs (+46) and SBs (+236). Both Larkin and Trammell are Hall of Fame shortstops. The argument against Rollins’ bid for the Hall begins and ends with his pedestrian .264 career average. But, as we’ve learned during the analytics age, batting average is not valued in the face of overall production. And that’s what Rollins was — a production monster. Just take a look at J-Roll’s resume highlights: • One of 13 players with at least 500 doubles, 100 triples and 200 HRs. Eleven of them are in the Hall.•  One of 6 shortstops with 2000 hits and 4 Gold Gloves. Four are in the Hall: Derek Jeter, Ozzie Smith, Luis Aparicio and Trammell.•  One of only 2 players to notch at least 30 doubles, 20 triples and 30 homers in the same season. The other is Hall of Fame first baseman Jim Bottomley. • One of the four members of the 20/20/20/20 club — 20-plus doubles, triples, homers and steals in a season. • One of only four players to collect at least 30 doubles, 20 home runs and 30 stolen bases in four different seasons.Other HOF credentials include:Owner of the eighth longest hitting streak in baseball history, reaching 38 games in 2005-06; elite-level defender, winning 4 Gold Gloves; and cornerstone of the Phillies’ five straight NL East titles from 2007-11.Rollins also has the prerequisite HOF bling — 1 MVP, 1 Silver Slugger and a 1 glorious World Series ring. So, what do you think... Rollins the Hall of Famer? He certainly has a strong case.And, before we go, how about a classic J-Roll moment:
