The World Economic Forum will postpone its annual meeting in Davos, Switzerland because of “continued uncertainty” over omicron, it announced Monday, the latest major international gathering to be cancelled as the variant continues its rapid spread.A security guard show the way to a man outside of the Davos Congress Centre under snow ahead of the  World Economic Forum 2018 annual meeting in Davos, eastern Switzerland on Jan. 22, 2018.

A virtual series did take place in January, however. The original 2022 forum was scheduled for January 17-21; the new summer date has yet to be announced.Davos is not the only major international meeting to be postponed since the discovery of the omicron variant last month. The World Trade Organization said it would indefinitely delay the ministerial conference it had planned in Geneva from late November through early December.Omicron uncertainty prompts WEF to delay Davos summit to mid-2022 (Reuters)World Economic Forum postpones Davos meeting on Covid uncertainty (CNBC)World Economic Forum Postpones January Davos Meeting on Omicron (Bloomberg)Davos 2022 postponed due to Omicron (Axios)
