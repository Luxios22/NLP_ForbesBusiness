These are not your 2019 49ers, a team whose strength in depth had them within seven minutes of a Super Bowl victory. However, in a season defined by the overwhelming parity across the NFL, the Niners do not necessarily need to possess the same level of talent to enjoy a successful season.San Francisco is 7-6, in position for a Wild Card berth in a top-heavy NFC. That may be seen as a disappointing season for a team many pegged as a Super Bowl contender, yet the Niners deserve credit for being in position to return to the playoffs despite clear deficiencies on the right side of the offensive line and in the secondary.Indeed, the 49ers—because of injuries at cornerback and to starting right tackle Mike McGlinchey—have two potential fatal flaws. Even with each of those issues negatively impacting the Niners in their Week 14 game with the Cincinnati Bengals, San Francisco heads into the final four games of the season with the odds indicating Kyle Shanahan's team will reach the postseason for the second time in three years.According to FiveThirtyEight, the 49ers—who would be the sixth seed in the NFC if the season ended today—have a 74 percent chance of making the playoffs following a run that has seen them win four of their last five games.That streak, including the Niners' dramatic overtime win over the Bengals, has largely been the product of San Francisco's several blue-chip players elevating the team to a level where they can compete with any team in the NFL.San Francisco might have the same depth as in 2019, but what the 49ers do have is a collection of players who are among the elite at their respective positions. Trent Williams has undoubtedly been the best left tackle in football this season, Deebo Samuel has established himself as one of the most versatile offensive weapons in the NFL while George Kittle has enjoyed a string of performances that have served as a reminder of his status as arguably the league's top tight end.On defense, Nick Bosa deserves to be a candidate for both Comeback Player of the Year and Defensive Player of the Year for a season in which he has racked up 14 sacks and 18 tackles for loss. Fred Warner may have taken a little step back from his stellar 2020, yet few of his contemporaries at linebacker can claim to have the same impact defending the pass and against the run.It is Samuel who has been the star of the show for much of the year, his ability to create explosive plays from both the wide receiver and running back spots seeing him rack up 14.1 scrimmage yards per touch, the second-most in the NFL, and 11 touchdowns, that tally tied for sixth-most.As the Niners survived the Bengals' comeback from 20-6 down to win 26-23 on the road in overtime last week, it was Kittle and Bosa who came to the fore.Kittle produced another monstrous display, recording 13 catches for 151 yards and a touchdown a week on from him exploding for nine catches for 181 yards and two scores in Week 13. He became the first tight end in NFL history to register at least 150 receiving yards and a touchdown in successive games but, more importantly, against the Bengals he consistently came through for quarterback Jimmy Garopppolo in the clutch. From his spectacular diving grab to set up Robbie Gould's failed game-winning field goal attempt to his three catches on the winning overtime drive, Kittle was the definition of reliable in a critical win for the Niners. Kittle only had the chance to help the Niners win the game because of a third-down sack from Bosa that held the Bengals to a field goal in overtime, that key play capping another dominant performance from the edge rusher.Bosa finished with a pair of sacks and had another called back by penalty. On a day when the 49ers consistently pressured Joe Burrow, Bosa led the charge in imposing fashion.But to pin the Niners' upturn in fortunes solely on those blue-chip talents would be unfair. Wide receiver Brandon Aiyuk dived in for the decisive touchdown versus Cincinnati and, because of the strides he has made over the last five weeks, he is averaging 8.6 yards per target, up from 7.6 in his rookie year. Jauan Jennings, who made a key back shoulder catch on that overtime drive, is producing increasingly significant contributions as a receiver and a blocker, while rookie sixth-round pick Elijah Mitchell had solidified himself as the team's top running back prior to a concussion and a knee injury that kept him out of the win over Cincinnati and will see him sidelined for the Week 15 clash with the Atlanta Falcons and likely the Week 16 trip to the Tennessee Titans.A well-stocked defensive line has provided pass-rushing support to Bosa, with this assistance coming primarily from the rapidly improving Arden Key, whose reward for excelling pass rushing from the interior and the edge has been a career-high four sacks.Behind him, the development of Azeez Al-Shaair has ensured the 49ers have suffered no drop-off when they have had to cope without Warner or Dre Greenlaw. With his athleticism, awareness, and impressive communication, Al-Shaair's emergence as an every-down linebacker is one of the stories of the Niners' season.That is not to say everything is perfect for San Francisco. The depth issues in the secondary and on the offensive line could yet sink the 49ers' hopes and, for this year at least, they remain reliant in a quarterback in Jimmy Garoppolo who is seemingly never far away from a devastating interception.Still, the 49ers are a team with a host of blue-chippers playing up to their talent and reputation while several lesser-heralded players are developing into difference-makers at the most pivotal point of the regular season.The Niners will need those elite members of the roster to maintain that standard to ensure they make the final 14 but, in a season where no team can be viewed as complete, these imperfect Niners could have the right recipe to spring a surprise come the postseason.
