Krampus is a terrifying foe in Call Of Duty: WarzoneKrampus—an evil demon monster plucked from European folklore who likes to terrorize naughty children at Christmas—has arrived in Warzone and Call Of Duty: Vanguard for the Festive Fervor holiday event.He’s quite horrible but in a fun—if at times frustrating—way.In Call Of Duty: Vanguard the beastly monster will target players who refuse to play the objective in objective-based modes, and campers in TDM.This is a wonderful idea that might—just might!—get players to actually play the damn objective. The point of Hardpoint isn’t to get the most kills, it’s to get the most time on the point! You won’t win a Domination match if you don’t capture Bravo!In Warzone the nightmarish bastard goes after people at random. When I first encountered him he was attacking another Duo, which I cleverly took advantage of, assisting him in the takedown before looting their corpses.The only problem with this strategy? Krampus immediately turned on me. The monster has 365 hit-points, which is more than a fully-armored opponent, but I think he must regain HP after he downs players or his health just regenerates over time, because the other Duo had clearly shot him a bunch, then I unloaded a clip into him, then when I was downed and my buddy showed up he did over 200 more damage and still Krampus did not die.We died. Krampus lived on to hunt again. You can watch it all in the video below:I’m also running a Free COD Points giveaway which you can check out on my YouTube channel. Thanks for stopping by!
