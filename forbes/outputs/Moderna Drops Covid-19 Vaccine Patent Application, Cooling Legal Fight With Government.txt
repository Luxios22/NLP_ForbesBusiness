Moderna has abandoned a patent application for a key part of its Covid-19 vaccine amid a dispute with the National Institutes of Health over who should be credited among the inventors, deferring a possible court battle between the company and the government.A vial of Moderna Vaccine sits on a counter waiting for nurses to daw from it at Hartford HealthCare  at Home in Bloomfield, Connecticut on February 12, 2021.

However, several 2020 Democratic presidential candidates, including now Vice President Kamala Harris, said the government should protect its intellectual property more assertively in order to curb prescription drug prices, Nature reported.$18 billion. That’s how much Moderna expects to make from the vaccine this year.It can be tricky to determine who should be listed as an inventor on a patent, biotechnology patent lawyer Eldora Ellison told Bloomberg, requiring careful analysis of the wording of patent claims and the intellectual contributions of different individuals, she said. Courts have acknowledged that “inventorship is one of the murkiest areas of the law,” she said.In a widely shared online video, former Fox News pundit Glenn Beck inaccurately claimed that the U.S. government “owns” the Moderna vaccine, suggesting that the government would promote vaccination in order to boost its own royalties.“Moderna Drops Pursuit of U.S. Patent for Key Component of Covid-19 Vaccine” (Wall Street Journal)“What the Moderna–NIH COVID vaccine patent fight means for research” (Nature)
