{"header": "Donald Trump Falls Off The Forbes 400 For First Time In 25\u00a0Years", "word": ["D", "onald Trump is worth", " an estimated $2.5 billion, leaving him $400 million short of the cutoff to make this year\u2019s Forbes 400 list of America\u2019s richest people. The real estate mogul is just as wealthy as he was a year ago, when he stood at No. 339 on the ranking, but he is down $600 million since the start of the pandemic. Technology stocks, cryptocurrencies and other assets have thrived in the Covid era. But big-city properties\u2014which make up the bulk of Trump\u2019s fortune\u2014have languished, knocking the former president out of the nation\u2019s most exclusive club. ", "If Trump is looking for someone to blame, he can start with himself. Five years ago, he had a golden opportunity to diversify his fortune. Fresh off the 2016 election, federal ethics officials were pushing Trump to divest his real estate assets. That would have allowed him to reinvest the proceeds into broad-based index funds and assume office free of conflicts of interest. ", "Others in the executive branch have little choice but to listen to ethics officials. People who hold assets that might conflict with their day jobs in government run the risk of violating the criminal conflicts-of-interest law. The president, however, is exempt from that statute, as Trump proudly noted during a press conference nine days before entering the White House. \u201cI could actually run my business and run government at the same time,\u201d he told a crowd of reporters assembled in Trump Tower. \u201cI don\u2019t like the way that looks, but I would be able to do that if I wanted to. I would be the only one that would be able to do that.\u201d ", "Trump decided to hang onto his assets. At the time, they were worth an estimated $3.5 billion, after subtracting debt. If he had instead chosen to sell off everything, there is a chance that he would have had to pay significant capital gains taxes. Trump acquired his five most valuable holdings long ago, so he likely has huge untaxed gains locked in each of them. If he paid the maximum possible capital gains tax\u201423.8% to the federal government, plus 8.8% to the New York State authorities on every penny he owned\u2014that would have shaved about $1.1 billion off his fortune, leaving him with $2.4 billion on the first day of his presidency. But what would have appeared to be a huge sacrifice at first could have turned into a lucrative realignment. By plowing that $2.4 billion in an index fund tracking the S&P 500, for example, Trump\u2019s fortune would have ballooned to $4.5 billion by now, leaving him 80% richer than he is today. His refusal to divest, in other words, cost him $2 billion. ", "And that\u2019s a conservative estimate\u2014it could have cost him far more. A little-known section in the federal tax code allows government workers who get rid of their holdings to obtain a document called a certificate of divestiture, which enables them to avoid paying capital gains taxes. Think of it as the government\u2019s way of enticing officials to do the right thing and avoid conflicts of interest. Since Trump was not subject to the conflict-of-interest statute, however, he may not have been able to secure the perk. Walter Shaub, who ran the Office of Government Ethics at the time Trump was transitioning into his new role, told ", "Forbes ", "he would have been happy to hand Trump a certificate of divestiture, but it\u2019s not clear whether officials inside the Internal Revenue Service would have honored the document. Trump\u2019s team didn\u2019t even ask about it, according to Shaub. \u201cThey never showed any interest in divestiture,\u201d he said. ", "Close-mindedness has its costs. If Trump had managed to avoid capital gains taxes, he could have theoretically reinvested $3.5 billion into the S&P 500 on the day he entered the White House. In that alternate scenario, Trump would have been worth an estimated $7 billion by this September, when ", "Forbes", " locked in estimates for its annual list, enough to earn a spot as the 133rd-richest person in the country. Instead, he\u2019s off The Forbes 400 for the first time in a quarter-century. "]},

According to ", "Flixed", ", there are now over 200 streaming providers worldwide. In 2021 Deloitte estimates in the U.S. an estimated 80% of U.S. households had at least one SVOD provider. Leichtman Research Group found 78% of all U.S. households have a subscription video on-Demand (SVOD) service from at least one of the three most established providers; Netflix \n ", " \n  ", "NFLX", " \n ", ", Amazon Prime, and Hulu.\u00a0In just a few short years SVOD has become a commodity in tens of millions of households. ", "Much of the growth has been fueled by content. A study from Hub Entertainment Research found about ", "one-third", " of streaming video subscribers had signed up for a service for just one show/movie unavailable anywhere else. This consumer behavior mirrors the premium pay cable industry. For example, despite producing some of the most iconic programming in the past 25 years, the household penetration of HBO subscribers never approached 50%. Subscriptions fluctuated based on the airing of popular limited series programs such as ", "The Sopranos ", "or ", "Game of Thrones", ". Clearly, viewers have shown a proclivity not to pay for a service they don\u2019t use. This puts pressure on SVOD programmers to find the next \u201cbig hit\u201d as soon as possible.", "Another example of viewers canceling their subscriptions for lack of use is basic cable. According to Nielsen, in 2008, the average number of TV channels available in a household was 129. Five years later, the number grew to 189 channels. Despite the substantial increase in channels available, the number of channels actually viewed per household each week ", "remained at 17", ". This is a primary reason that media conglomerates bundled their networks when negotiating subscriber fees with cable operators. As prices continued to escalate and other viewing options became available, subscribers eventually balked at paying for channels they never watched, leading to cord cutting. ", "Digital media is another example, despite all the ad supported online choices now available, the digital duopoly remains popular. eMarketer forecasts Facebook and Google are expected to account for ", "over half", " the digital media dollars invested in 2021 (when Amazon is added the share of market increases to 61%). Media consumption patterns are prevalent in other media too. Every person has their favorite radio stations (preset in their cars) and podcasts. Also, readers will pay to subscribe to their favorite magazines, newspapers and websites. ", "SVOD is also facing \u00a0similar challenges. With the lockdown and the launches of new SVOD services, the average number of SVOD services consumers subscribed to increased. As persons returned to their pre-pandemic activities (i.e., returning to the office), the number of SVOD per household flattened. An indication that, similar to the amount of television channels viewed, radio stations listened to or magazines read, consumers also have limitations with the amount of streaming video providers they will watch and subscribe to.\u00a0", "Subscriber counts for several SVOD services have been slowing after a period of rapid subscriber growth. Disney\u2019s \n ", " \n  ", "DIS", " \n ", " latest ", "earnings report", " released in October 2021, found 2.1 million net new subscribers worldwide, down from 12.1 million from the previous quarter. Other more recently launched SVOD services from NBCUniversal, WarnerMedia and ViacomCBS have also recently reported sluggish subscriber growth. Expect the slow growth to continue into 2022, ", "Deloitte", " estimates in 2022 churn will increase by 30%, as 150 million SVOD subscribers worldwide are expected to cancel a service. ", "To sustain growth, Jon Giegengack, the Founder and Principal of Hub Entertainment Research, expects consolidation and mergers to drive greater competition than Netflix has seen before. \u201cNetflix has dominated streaming, but as competing media companies invest more in content and networks to save their best IP for their own platforms, Netflix will have to fight harder to maintain its position as the \u2018home base\u2019 for streaming consumers.\u201d\u00a0", "The first consolidation merger in the SVOD era was when Disney acquired assets from Fox which was approved by government regulators in March 2019. The $71.3 billion deal gave Disney access to the extensive content library from Fox. The deal provided programming for Disney+ which was launched that November as well as a majority stake in Hulu. More recently, in May 2021 Discovery \n ", " \n  ", "DISCA", " \n ", " announced plans to acquire WarnerMedia from AT&T \n ", " \n  ", "T", " \n ", " for $43 billion. The consolidation of two media conglomerates will make it more competitive with Netflix and other large SVOD providers. Despite some anti-trust concerns from Congress, the deal is expected to be finalized by mid-year 2022. ", "There are other strategies SVOD services can use to compete with Netflix and others including bolstering their programming library. For example, in May 2021 Amazon announced they will acquire the MGM library for $8.5 billion. Other content libraries may soon be sold to SVOD providers such as Lionsgate or AMC. ", "Another strategy is consolidation, in April 2021, NBCUniversal folded the streaming WWE Network into Peacock. eMarketer expects in the future media conglomerates will further consolidate their streaming assets. Hulu could consolidate with Disney+ and ViacomCBS may fold Pluto TV into Paramount+. Of course, there could be more blockbuster mergers among media conglomerates. ", "Based on consumer behavior there will be only a handful of successful SVOD providers in the years ahead. These services will need a steady stream of compelling content and at an affordable price. In 2022 and beyond the industry can expect a wave of mergers, partnerships and acquisitions as the SVOD market consolidates. The goal is to be one of a handful of SVOD survivors."]},

Not only that, whether you love or hate the looks, it made a statement on the road, and still does. But more recently BMW\u2019s electrification plans have stalled, with only the exceedingly fun but range compromised ", "Mini Electric", " arriving since the i3\u2019s introduction for mainstream buyers. Now, however, BMW is back with a brand-new range of pure electric platforms. The most exciting one is the i4, which is clearly aimed at the ", "Tesla Model 3", ". But can it really compete?", "The BMW i4 M50 is ready to munch through miles at high speed and in considerable comfort.", "BMW has been the king of European saloon car manufacturers for decades, although Mercedes and Audi might have a few issues with that statement. Here in the UK, the 3-series BMW is ubiquitous, offering an undeniable blend of driving thrills and four-door practicality. The 320d took over from the Ford Mondeo as a more upmarket transport for sales reps, able to chew through miles with purposeful intent and reasonable economy. The i4 is clearly a larger vehicle but sits in the same category as the 3- and 5-series, aimed at high mileage business drivers who may also want to transport their families.", "It is a bit longer than a Tesla Model 3, but otherwise has very similar dimensions \u2013 and intentions. This is another car that\u2019s meant to be the electric saloon/sedan for the mainstream premium market, which surprisingly hasn\u2019t been a popular category for EVs yet with many other automakers. Only the Model 3 and Polestar 2 compete in this area, with most other manufacturers aiming at SUVs and crossovers.", "The M50 has all-wheel-drive and huge amounts of power.", "There are two main flavors of i4 at launch. The eDrive40 is rear-wheel-drive with 340hp, and the M50 is all-wheel-drive with 544hp. Then there are two trim levels of i4 eDrive40 \u2013 the basic Sport and the M Sport. Pricewise, the eDrive40 and M50 are broadly competitive with the Tesla Model 3 Long Range and Performance respectively in the UK. The i4 eDrive40 starts at \u00a351,905 ($68,800) for the Sport and \u00a353,405 ($70,800) for the M Sport. The i4 M50 is \u00a363,905 ($84,700). In contrast, in the UK, the Tesla Model 3 Long Range is \u00a349,990 ($66,300) and the Performance is \u00a359,990 ($79,500). So the BMW i4 is a little more expensive but not extortionately so, although option packs will push the price up a bit further.", "The i4 I drove was the M50. Having arrived in a Tesla Model 3 Performance for the launch event, I had the perfect comparison. The M50 takes 3.9 seconds to reach 62mph, whereas the Model 3 Performance takes 3.1 seconds to hit 60mph. But the latter is also with rollout so in practice the Tesla is likely to be only fractionally quicker. However, the throttle isn\u2019t quite so brutally responsive on the BMW. The torque is still very immediate, but takes a split second longer to kick in.", "The i4 eDrive40 is considerably slower, taking 5.7 seconds to hit 62mph. That is also a lot more than the Tesla Model 3 Long Range, which hits 60mph in 4.2 seconds and can be upgraded to make it 3.7 seconds. The ", "Polestar 2 Long range Dual motor", " should also be mentioned here, as that can also be upgraded to hit 62mph in 4.4 seconds and is quite a bit cheaper than either BMW or Tesla.", "The i4 M50 is an incredible driver's car, as you'd hope from a high-performance BMW.", "If you\u2019re a previous BMW owner, it\u2019s likely that one of the things you most liked about your car was the steering. Every BMW I\u2019ve driven, even old and tired ones, have incredibly solid, precise handling. The i3 has this too. The i4 M50 has it in spades. Once you get used to the dynamics, you will be throwing this large, heavy car around corners with immense confidence. The eDrive40 weights 2,050kg, and the M50 is 2,215kg, both of which are a lot more than a Tesla Model 3 Dual Motor. However, the Porsche Taycan is also heavy but dynamically brilliant. The i4 M50 still manages to be an involving car when pushed, in a similar fashion to the Taycan.", "So the i4 M50 is very much a driver\u2019s car. The handling isn\u2019t quite as awe-inspiring as the Porsche Taycan 4S or Turbo, but it\u2019s still excellent. The center of gravity is lower than a 3-series, although strangely 34mm for the M50 and a larger 53mm for the edDrive40. BMW has found a commendable middle ground in ride quality too, which is firm enough for dependable roadholding at the same time as being soft enough to deal with uneven surfaces and bumps.", "One of the things that might well tempt you towards BMW from Tesla is the interior. The Model 3 is famously spartan inside, with very few buttons and just the giant central screen to control virtually everything. BMW has reduced the complexity of its control systems for the i4, but there are still plenty of discrete buttons for important functions. Nevertheless, the dashboard is dominated by a wide dual screen display that spans from the instrumentation behind the steering wheel to media and infotainment in the middle. This runs the 8", "th", " generation of BMWs operating system and is packed with connected features. There\u2019s a HUD on the M50 that adds useful info right in the drivers view.", "The BMW i4 has loads of space in the rear for luggage.", "Like the Polestar 2, and unlike the Model 3, the i4 is actually a hatchback disguised as a four-door. This means that the opening into the boot / trunk is much taller than the Tesla, which many will appreciate. The door also has an electric release and close, like the Polestar 2 and 2021 Tesla Model 3. The luggage capacity in the rear is a very commendable 470 liters with the rear seats up, and 1,290 liters with them down. These are both larger figures than the Tesla Model 3, and you also get the option to open the middle section of the rear seats on its own for a long item, while leaving the two outer seats up for passengers. The i4 can tow, too \u2013 up to 750kg unbraked, and a decent 1,600kg braked.", "BMW clearly wanted to take Tesla on fully when it comes to range. After all, this car is meant to be a \u201cbahn stormer\u201d capable of long journeys at speed and in comfort. This is what BMWs are famous for. The WLTP range of the two i4 flavors is quite differentiated, however. The eDrive40 can go for 367 miles \u2013 even more than a Tesla Model 3 Long Range, and one of the longest of any current EV. The M50 has a more modest 316 miles of range, which is lower than the current Tesla Model 3 Performance\u2019s 340 miles.", "BMW has simplified its interior, but not to Tesla levels.", "Still, both i4 versions should be more than capable of lengthy travel, aided by BMW\u2019s bundled charging membership, which includes bp pulse and IONITY in the UK, as well as around 170,000 chargers across Europe. DC charging up to 200kW is supported, too, so you will be able to replenish the 83.9kWh battery (80.7kWh net) quickly with a powerful enough charger.", "So has BMW finally given Tesla\u2019s imperious Model 3 something to worry about? Well, there is no version of the i4 cheap enough to compete with the Standard Range Plus, which is now a bit slower than it was at launch but has a longer 305 miles of range than before. It is \u00a38,000 ($10,600) cheaper than the i4 eDrive40 Sport, but the latter is a little quicker and has longer range. While the i4 eDrive40 isn\u2019t as quick as the Model 3 Long Range, its WLTP range is a longer here too. The BMW brand may well convince quite a few to purchase this model despite the higher price.", "The i4 looks like a four-door sedan, but it's actually a hatchback.", "The M50, however, is a more clearly tempting proposition. The extra weight negates the additional engine power it has over the Tesla Model 3 Performance and means it\u2019s not an heir to the legendary fossil fuel-driven BMW M3s of yore. But it is brilliant to drive, very comfortable on long journeys, and extremely well equipped. It doesn\u2019t trounce Tesla but shows that BMW knows how to put a quality performance EV together. I fully expect senior company executives to be driving them in droves when deliveries arrive in 2022."]},

", "He\u2019s since turned on the jets and has carried the short-handed Bucks in a number of games. Beginning with their November 22nd contest against the Orlando Magic, Holiday has averaged 20.7 points, 4.9 rebounds and 7 assists per game while shooting 38.1 percent from downtown and 54.4 percent from the field overall.", "Holiday has been forced into carrying the load with a number of guys out due to various injuries and health and safety protocols. Khris Middleton has missed the last two games with a knee injury (don\u2019t worry Bucks\u2019 fans, he should return very soon) while Giannis Antetokounmpo has missed four games and counting during that stretch, and Bobby Portis missed the last contest due to health and safety protocols. Oh, and Donte DiVincenzo hasn\u2019t played yet this season and Brook Lopez continues to be out indefinitely.", "Milwaukee isn\u2019t the only team experiencing these issues, but it has put a heavy burden on whomever they have had available. After being mostly healthy throughout Mike Budenholzer\u2019s first three years, this is a different type of challenge for the team.", "At 19-12, the Bucks are staying afloat near the top of the Eastern Conference Standings. They are tied with the Chicago Bulls for second and three games behind the Brooklyn Nets in first. ", "Back to Holiday. He\u2019s undoubtedly playing the best ball of his short Bucks\u2019 tenure and probably the best he\u2019s ever played in his career. ", "He\u2019s coming off a career-high 40 points (while also accounting for five rebounds and five assists) in a thrilling overtime loss to the New Orleans Pelicans. He was nearly unstoppable in that game, getting to the lane almost at will and connecting on a number of nifty finishes both around the rim and from the mid-range. ", "For all the defensive attention he\u2019s received since the Bucks\u2019 championship run (and rightfully so), his offense has become underrated. To be fair, he had a number of stinkers throughout the playoffs, but he\u2019s come to rediscover his offensive touch over the last 14 games. Over that span, he\u2019s scored 26 or more points on four occasions and at least 20 points in eight of those games. Not bad for someone who couldn\u2019t hit the water if he fell out of a boat earlier in the season.", "Perhaps, the way he\u2019s been doing it has been most impressive. ", "Holiday isn\u2019t somebody who is going to blow by his man on the perimeter with a quick first step or elite quickness. Instead, he has to rely on just enough quickness to get an edge on his man, elite guard strength to bully his way close (enough) to the rim, and an underrated bag of step-backs, cross-overs, between the leg dribbles and footwork to create an opening for his shot. ", "In the above play, the Pelicans switch Brandon Ingram and his 7-foot-3 wingspan onto Holiday in the left corner. No matter, Holiday stuns his defender with an in-and-out dribble to get him a bit off balance, takes one more dribble toward the hoop and then hits him with a step-back that nearly takes him out of bounds to the baseline. At this point, Holiday not only has to contend with Ingram\u2019s long arms, but now he\u2019s also shooting over the corner of the backboard. Cool as the other side of the pillow, he drains the shot and brings the Bucks to within two points with less than four minutes to play.", "Oh, and that touch. That sweet, sweet touch he has. When a shot is released from his hands you sometimes wonder if that baby is going to touch the clouds. Instead, it has found its way to the bottom of the net more times than not during this hot stretch.", " All of this has resulted in elite efficiency for the current lone standing member of the Bucks\u2019 big three. Since November 22nd, he\u2019s been a fiend no matter where he\u2019s shot the ball. According to Cleaning the Glass, he ranks in the 66th percentile among point guards when it comes to finishing around the rim, the 100th percentile in the mid-range, and the 61st percentile behind the three-point line. All of this to say that his 59.7 percent effective field goal percentage has ranked in the 97th percentile among point guards over that span.", "Milwaukee has needed very point of this scoring outburst, as they scratch tooth and nail to keep up in the Eastern Conference Standings. Although they won the NBA championship last year as the 3-seed, they\u2019d prefer to at least have home court advantage in the second round of the playoffs.", "With a lot of basketball left to be played before the seeding is finalized, sit back, relax, and enjoy the (Jrue) Holiday season."]},

They do not need to be melded together. That being said, it would be useful for the two to electronically communicate with each other.", "Why so?", "Consider that one aspect of riding inside a car and the ambiance thereof can include the driving aspects of the vehicle.

For example, maybe the self-driving car could avoid roads that have potholes and are rocky, which a passenger might wish to avoid due to getting jostled while riding in the vehicle. Thus, when the AI driving system is making use of the GPS and the various maps for navigation, this qualm or desire by the rider ought to be taken into account.", "There is a slew of ambiance factors that can be adjusted by a car-based Ambient Intelligence system.", "We\u2019ve already covered some of the temperature aspects.

", "As earlier mentioned, thermal sensors might be used to detect the temperatures of the passengers. Another means of trying to figure out the temperatures of the riders could be via using facial recognition. There will be inward-facing cameras in self-driving cars, and those cameras could be used to try and detect if someone is sweating, or otherwise showcasing mannerisms and effects of either being too hot or being too cold.", "Lighting inside a self-driving car will be adjustable. There are interior lights that can be switched on or off, along with being dimmed or brightened on a spectrum of illumination. Some expect that self-driving cars will have some form of window shades that can be automatically rolled up or down, allowing for privacy and darkness within the vehicle.", "The rationale for those curtaining elements would be that people might opt to take naps or sleep while inside a self-driving car.

If there are other passengers on board, you might want to face them and have an engaging dialogue, or maybe play cards or chess together.", "The Ambient Intelligence component might glean over time your preferences for which way the swivel seats should be oriented.

For AI systems, there are ongoing advances in Natural Language Processing (NLP), such as the likes of Alexa and Siri. By using that kind of NLP capability, the self-driving car can ask the rider what their preferences are. This certainly simplifies matters greatly.", "Ask, and you shall receive, as they say.", "The AI system could store the results of a person\u2019s preferences and then use those preferences whenever the person gets into the self-driving car.

In that case, passengers will have no particular preference of selecting one fleet over another when they request a lift.", "That\u2019s not good news for those fleet operators. They want you to pick their specific fleet. This is all going to be a money-making enterprise, and each fleet operator will be trying to lure passengers to use their fleet more so than someone else\u2019s fleet.", "One answer to this standout desire would be to have a fleet of self-driving cars that are really good at this ambiance matter. When advertising a fleet, the operator could tout that they have the best available Ambient Intelligence systems. Your every whim of interior ambiance will be accommodated by their facility. That might be quite an attractor for some.", "Meanwhile, those passengers that don\u2019t like the AI doing these interior ambiance adjustments will presumably be able to merely switch off the feature. If you don\u2019t like the AI trying to play a game of figuring out your preferences, you don\u2019t need to play the game. Indeed, some will likely find it eerie to consider that your in-car ambiance preferences are being stored in a cloud someplace and readily retrievable. ", "That brings us to a thorny question: ", "Is this attempt at tailoring ambiance a privacy intrusion?", "That is an unresolved issue that is bound to arise once the Ambient Intelligence systems are incorporated into self-driving cars. For now, no one is thinking about that tough question. ", "The odds are that you\u2019ll need to do things for yourself for the time being, such as setting the A/C, opening the windows, etc. \u00a0In the future, some will prefer being treated like royalty and have the AI take care of those tasks, thus riding along without a care in the world and amidst an idyllic environment that turns the riding journey into a dreamy experience.", "Those are dreams that could someday come true."]},

The Qatari capital is a permanent construction site where laborers toil relentlessly in the heat to ready the city for soccer\u2019s ultimate party.\u00a0", "The Arab Cup offered a preview and flavor: a compact World Cup embedded in the Middle East\u2019s culture.

He became the first tight end in NFL history to register at least 150 receiving yards and a touchdown in successive games but, more importantly, against the Bengals he consistently came through for quarterback Jimmy Garopppolo in the clutch.

On a day when the 49ers consistently pressured Joe Burrow, Bosa led the charge in imposing fashion.", "But to pin the Niners' upturn in fortunes solely on those blue-chip talents would be unfair. Wide receiver Brandon Aiyuk dived in for the decisive touchdown versus Cincinnati and, because of the strides he has made over the last five weeks, he is averaging 8.6 yards per target, up from 7.6 in his rookie year. ", "Jauan Jennings, who made a key back shoulder catch on that overtime drive, is producing increasingly significant contributions as a receiver and a blocker, while rookie sixth-round pick Elijah Mitchell had solidified himself as the team's top running back prior to a concussion and a knee injury that kept him out of the win over Cincinnati and will see him sidelined for the Week 15 clash with the Atlanta Falcons and likely the Week 16 trip to the Tennessee Titans.", "A well-stocked defensive line has provided pass-rushing support to Bosa, with this assistance coming primarily from the rapidly improving Arden Key, whose reward for excelling pass rushing from the interior and the edge has been a career-high four sacks.", "Behind him, the development of Azeez Al-Shaair has ensured the 49ers have suffered no drop-off when they have had to cope without Warner or Dre Greenlaw. With his athleticism, awareness, and impressive communication, Al-Shaair's emergence as an every-down linebacker is one of the stories of the Niners' season.", "That is not to say everything is perfect for San Francisco. The depth issues in the secondary and on the offensive line could yet sink the 49ers' hopes and, for this year at least, they remain reliant in a quarterback in Jimmy Garoppolo who is seemingly never far away from a devastating interception.", "Still, the 49ers are a team with a host of blue-chippers playing up to their talent and reputation while several lesser-heralded players are developing into difference-makers at the most pivotal point of the regular season.", "The Niners will need those elite members of the roster to maintain that standard to ensure they make the final 14 but, in a season where no team can be viewed as complete, these imperfect Niners could have the right recipe to spring a surprise come the postseason."]},

", "It\u2019s all a reminder of a very uplifting truth: credit is easily the world\u2019s most fungible commodity. Innovative Chinese entrepreneurs and businesses are not limited by the amount of credit flowing within China itself. And as evidenced by massive capital flows from the world\u2019s savers into the hands of American visionaries, neither is the U.S. limited by credit produced stateside. And ", "it is", " \u201ccredit produced.\u201d ", "Contrary to the popular view that credit availability is a consequence of central bank generosity, the reality is that credit is always and everywhere an effect of production. Entrepreneurs and businesses seek money for what it can be exchanged for (think trucks, tractors, computers, phones, desks, chairs, paperclips, etc.), at which point the mildly sentient can logically see the connection between production and credit availability. Put another way, no one borrows money. Nor do they lend it. Lending and borrowing are always, always, always the shift of resources from one set of hands to another at a rate of interest sufficient for the lender to forego resource access. ", "All of which brings us back to China. Nguyen and Phillips note that \u201cAs of October, there were 282 Chinese stocks listed in the United States, valued at roughly $1.7 trillion.\u201d The total amounts to roughly 3 percent of the U.S. stock market according to the reporters, but it\u2019s 3 percent of a huge number. Not only do Chinese companies covet \u201cthe deep pockets and cachet of overseas investors,\u201d they actively access their capital. Please think about this in terms of recent commentary, and commentary going back decades. In his weekly conversation with Gail Collins, the very excellent ", "New York Times", " columnist Bret Stephens observed about inflation that \u201cWe could bring it down with higher interest rates, and eventually we will probably have to, though that would very likely cause a recession, like it did in the early 1980s.\u201d In the ", "Wall Street Journal", ", former Fed vice chairman Kevin Warsh asserted that when \u201cmonetary policy is too tight, it slows aggregate demand.\u201d More broadly, it\u2019s believed to this day that the late Paul Volcker \u201cwhipped\u201d inflation by hiking the Fed funds rate well into the double digits in the early 1980s. According to those who think they\u2019re in the know, \u201ctight\u201d credit slowed inflation. Wrong, wrong, and wrong. ", "And if the above argument is doubted, consider China again. It ultimately doesn\u2019t matter too much what the Bank of China does, or the CCP, or monetary authorities in general in China. So long as there are productive, innovative business ideas happening in China, there will be capital to fund them. ", "The globalized nature of credit speaks to how false are the assumptions that the Federal Reserve could cause a \u201crecession\u201d or a slowdown in \u201caggregate demand\u201d by raising the Fed funds rate. Such a view presumes that U.S. is an impregnable island in the credit sense. Except that it isn\u2019t. Goodness, if Chinese businesses can easily work around domestic barriers to credit, can anyone seriously believe the Fed capable of cutting off credit access in the very country that is so attractive to the world\u2019s savers? And if your belief is that the Fed, by \u201csetting\u201d the rate for short-term credit can make it \u201ctight,\u201d think again. The cost of credit is set in world markets. To pretend that the Fed can control it is just silly. And naive. ", "All of which speaks to end an endless myth about the early 1980s that just won\u2019t die. Supposedly Paul Volcker arrested inflation with \u201ctight money.\u201d The belief is absurd on too many levels to count. But with brevity in mind, it should first be said that inflation is a decline in the value of the unit; in our case, the dollar. Measured in gold, the dollar hit all-time lows of $875 with Volcker as Fed chair. To which those with a reasonable understanding of monetary history will point out that the dollar\u2019s exchange value has never been part of the Fed\u2019s portfolio as is. About this, the reasonable would be right. The Fed is not empowered to control inflation as it\u2019s historically been understood to be. ", "The Volcker myth also presumes that economic growth causes inflation, and that the contraction allegedly engineered by Volcker (he didn\u2019t, but that\u2019s another column) an inflation killer. Except that the Phillips Curve is an easy-to-discredit myth. Precisely because economic growth springs from investment meant to enhance productivity, what economists think is inflationary is the surest sign of rapidly falling prices. Too bad Republicans embrace what\u2019s discredited in pursuit of hagiography that Ronald Reagan (the president whom Volcker served after Jimmy Carter\u2019s loss) himself would likely dismiss were he around to dismiss it. ", "Lastly, it cannot be stressed enough that the Fed cannot control total credit in the U.S. as is. No doubt it\u2019s fun for economists and pundits to imagine the central bank taking away the proverbial \u201cpunch bowl,\u201d but the happier reality is that credit is yet again a global concept. And as such, global resources are relentlessly pushed by investors to their highest use. It\u2019s a long or short way of saying that credit access isn\u2019t a consequence of central bank \u201cease\u201d or \u201ctightness\u201d as much as it\u2019s a certain consequence of productive ideas. Translated for those who need it, if you have a good idea money will find you. ", "It\u2019s no surprise that economic types want to believe all good things run through central planners, but readers of political and economic commentary would be wise to be skeptical. The Fed\u2019s power is well overstated. Thankfully. If it had the power that some believe, economies around the world would be so wrecked as to not be worth talking about."]},

(Photo by Douglas P. DeFelice/Getty Images)", "On Friday night, the news broke that the Houston Rockets were waiving forward Danuel House. House, 28, was in the third year of a three-year, $11.15 million contract which was paying him a very team friendly $3.89 million this season. After a contract dispute during his first season with the team, 2018-2019, the team used part of its mid-level exception in 2019 to sign House to his current deal. He is set to become an unrestricted free agent this summer. ", "The move signals that there was just no market for House whose production sharply decreased this season. On the year, in 14.5 minutes per game, House averaged 4.8 points, 2.7 rebounds, and 1.2 assists, shooting 33.8% from the floor and 29.4% on 3s. In his best season with the team, his first year, he shot 46.8% from the floor and 41.6% on 4.6 three-point attempts per game, averaging 9.4 points and 3.6 rebounds in 25.1 minutes per game. ", "Per NBA.com, with House on the floor this year, the Rockets had an offensive rating of 103.1 and a defensive rating of 107.0; overall, the team has had an offensive rating of 104.9 and a defensive rating of 111.6. Even setting aside House\u2019s poor production, the team clearly wanted to prioritize playing time for younger options at the wing position such as Armoni Brooks, Garrison Mathews, and Kenyon Martin Jr. House was the odd man out and his lack of production this year did not help matters.", "Per the league\u2019s collective bargaining agreement, if a team makes a successful waiver claim, it acquires the player and his existing contract, and pays the remainder of his salary, with the waiving team relieved of all responsibility for the player. This rarely actually happens. It is far more common for teams to wait for the player to clear waivers. After a player clears waivers, he becomes a free agent and is free to sign with the team of his choice. The player\u2019s roster spot is freed up as soon as the team places the player on waivers and the team can sign a new player or acquire one via trade immediately, not needing to wait for the player to be claimed or to clear waivers.", "If a player is waived between September 1 and June 30, then the current season\u2019s salary is paid per the normal payment schedule. The salary amount continues to be included in team salary, though it is subject to reduction through the right of set-off if the player signs with any professional team. ", "House should get a look elsewhere given his skillset and body of work. In theory, his abilities would be desirable in a bench role for any contender - he can spread the floor and guard multiple positions. The Brooklyn Nets\u2014given the James Harden connection and that team\u2019s need for active bodies\u2014would seem to make sense as an option."]},

If the owner of a franchise likes the roster and doesn't ever want to tear it down for higher draft picks, then refashioning the roster isn't going to happen on a large scale.", "But Simon also said that he believes teams that are not doing well need to make changes around the edges. And that is where the Pacers are. They're in 13th place in the Eastern Conference, and they finished in ninth place last season. Even if the team is likeable in the owner\u2019s eyes and has the talent to win more games than they actually have, the results are what they are.", "So how do the Pacers, and the decision makers that Simon trusts, proceed with all of these feelings and constraints? The owner likes the team and won\u2019t tear it down, but confesses that teams in a substandard situation should try to improve on the edges. How can both of those opinions be reconciled? At some point, it may be almost necessary to appeal to fans by adjusting directions in some way.", "Simon has his own idea of what that resolution looks like. He describes it as building on the go.", "\u201cWe always built without without tearing down, built on the go,\u201d Simon said. \u201cAnd we can do the same thing. We can have a good team and get better rather than break it up to get better.\u201d", "Building on the go is extremely difficult. If it was easy to elevate a roster from good to great, more teams would do it. But it's not simple \u2014 it\u2019s incredibly challenging.", "Yet Simon is optimistic about this path forward for the Pacers, should they decide to make changes. And while it's a difficult team-building objective, it's understandable why he feels it\u2019s feasible. First and foremost, leaders and owners tend to be positive about the direction their team is headed in general. Simon played a part, mostly via spending and hiring, to get the Pacers to this point. He is going to believe in what the outcomes of his decisions will be, even if the results aren\u2019t there yet.", "NBA Commissioner Adam Silver, left, is joined by Indiana Pacers owner Herb Simon, right, and Larry ", "... [+]", " Bird, after he announced in Indianapolis, Wednesday, Dec. 13, 2017 that Indianapolis will host the 2021 NBA All-Star game . (AP Photo/Michael Conroy)", "The other reason Indiana's owner may believe in this route forward is that he has seen it work multiple times before. Former Pacers General Manager Donnie Walsh built on the go in the early 2000s \u2014 he turned a Pacers team that won just 41 games in 2001 to a Conference Finals contender just three years later. Roughly one decade later, former President of Basketball Operations Larry Bird did something similar. With an assist from Walsh, he took a good Pacers team and made it great \u2014 the Pacers won just 37 games in 2011, but would go on to reach the Conference Finals twice in the next three seasons. The team from the Circle City has a unique history of success with a demanding team-building strategy.", "Despite Indiana's past successes building on the go, countless other franchises have failed to do so. Simon deserves credit for putting the right people in decision-making roles to make it work in the past. But there is always a luck element to these things. Multiple General Managers have admitted such in NBA history.", "That's not to say the Pacers have to get lucky to get better. But even the people who have to make the decisions have described good fortune as a factor in team building, and such statements do help crystallize how tricky it can be to build on the go, as Simon wants to do.", "Because there is a luck element, and because Simon likes his current team, this organization may make no big moves at all this season. Simon did say \u201caround the edges\u201d when describing where a struggling team may makes changes, after all. But despite all of these notes and quotes, the Pacers making only small tweaks feels unlikely given the team's record and the fact that starting center ", "Myles Turner publicly requested a larger role", ". Turner made it clear he isn't requesting a trade himself or taking a shot at anyone, but it is difficult to see him getting more clarity on a larger role in basketball games unless he or others are dealt to another team. Plus, Simon himself said that squads who aren\u2019t doing well can undergo major changes.", "So, where does all this leave the Pacers? Simon doesn't want to get worse now to get better later, but going from 13th place to a playoff team just by making a few moves around the edges is nearly impossible. What is going to give? ", "That\u2019s difficult to say. The current situation in Indiana leaves team decision makers with an incredibly small margin for error. They have to find a way to make the Pacers better, and try to get the talent required to succeed in the postseason, without grabbing a high draft pick. That's a difficult objective, and one that will take time. But time is of the essence as the link between the franchise and its fans becomes more tenuous.", "Simon thinks the Pacers can get stars, or at least players who have the talent to give the team a significant boost, in free agency. When he was asked about being unable to acquire elite talent in free agency, he rejected the premise of the question. But history says the question is more than fair. All the best players in Indiana\u2019s franchise history \u2014 Reggie Miller, Paul George, Jermaine O'Neal, Victor Oladipo, and Danny Granger to name a few \u2014 were acquired via the draft or via a trade. Free agency hasn't been kind to the Pacers, or other non-glamor markets, throughout the last few decades of NBA history. Since the Pacers won\u2019t bottom out, perhaps an aggressive trade for a high-impact player would satisfy Simon\u2019s build on the go strategy.", "The Pacers owner also said he would be willing to spend on stars if they had interest in the Pacers. He has opened up the checkbook for David West, Paul George, Domantas Sabonis, and Malcolm Brogdon this decade. None of those players were mega talents at the time they inked a deal with the blue and gold, but they are very good players who serve as evidence that Simon would pay up to improve his team. The Pacers have a local reputation of being a somewhat budget-conscious franchise, but they currently ", "rank 15th in player spending", " and Pritchard has mentioned in the past that Simon has always been willing to spend when Pritchard finds a productive signing available.", "Indiana's owner also recently provided funds for a new practice facility and some funding for the renovations to Gainbridge Fieldhouse, the Pacers recently-updated stadium. He is willing to allocate funds to improve the franchise.", "Given where the team is now, that must continue. Part of not bottoming out is continuing to spend. So, while trades are probably needed for the Pacers to get better and lure some eyeballs back to the team, spending to keep the team relevant \u2014 a term used by Pacers head coach Rick Carlisle when he was discussing his new team this offseason \u2014 is imperative.", "Continued spending and an aggressive pursuit of upgrades are just two specific tasks for the Pacers to execute if they want to build on the go and light more fire in the franchise, both in terms of team success and fan engagement. \u201cWhy would we want to go through a rebuild when we can build on the go? That's the talent,\u201d Simon said. Donnie [Walsh] did it all the time. Larry [Bird] did it. Kevin will do it. We can do it.\u201d ", "Kevin will do it. That\u2019s a powerful statement, and Pritchard and Simon do have a strong relationship. But how Pritchard will do it remains to be seen. Walsh and Bird built on the go, but it took a few seasons. Perhaps Pritchard\u2019s next moves are smaller, but are important in setting up bigger moves in the future.", "That directional choice would mesh with Simon's comments, which may have tipped that the Pacers are looking to make subtle changes. His comments also may indicate that the team will relax and stay out of panic mode. He didn't detail the Pacers exact direction.", "But he did explain that he thinks the Pacers can build on the go and can get better from where they are right now. He thinks the current core is that of a playoff team. But the Pacers are 73-77 in their last 150 games. If they are a playoff team that can build on the go, it's time for the franchise to prove it. Because right now, they are a team that the owner likes, but not a team that is accomplishing anything."]},

His full text can be seen ", "here", ", so rather than just repeat what he has written I will list his five items and give my thoughts and how effective each these would be:", "Sometimes this happens today, but not always. Dombroff suggests that when the FAA proposes a fine for bad onboard behavior, they list the offender\u2019s full legal name. This \u201ctown square\u201d approach is simple and likely would be effective. Some may consider this a form of doxing, but that term is associated with malicious intent and this wouldn't be the case here. The idea is not to smear the individual who performs this terrible behavior on an airplane, but rather create a strong incentive not to do it in the first place. Once someone\u2019s name is made public associated with this act, all kinds of consequences for job, family, church, and more could follow. Strong incentive indeed. ", "The FAA proposes fines but does not not have the legal authority to enforce a fine. When the FAA levies a fine, it goes into the U.S. court system where resolutions can take a long time and often settle for pennies on the dollar. Headlines like \u201c", "FAA proposes more than $500,000 in new fines against unruly passengers", "\u201d look great, but the bark is often much worse than the bite. This piece of Dombroff\u2019s proposal may be the most difficult to enforce but would also be among the most effective. ", "To be fair, it\u2019s not as if someone thinks carefully about the fine they might receive and the probability of having to pay it before lashing out and punching a flight attendant. But follow-on stories of the hardships this fine caused would serve as another important incentive not to behave badly in the first place.", "Interfering with the flight crew in the performance of their duties is a criminal offense: ", "49 USC \u00a746504", ". This statute allows jail time of up to 20 years for violence against a flight crew member without a weapon, and up to life imprisonment with a weapon. No doubt that flight attendants would support this initiative, as failing to follow orders today usually gets an eye-roll or less as a consequence. Taken with the first two items, being sent to jail, fined a real amount, and having your name published, means that this behavior would stop very quickly after an unfortunate few don't get the message and show the effects for all. ", "This idea is broad but makes a lot of sense, and could apply not only in the case of disruptive passengers. If you are in a restaurant and have a heart attack, an ambulance will be called and your health insurance will cover that cost along with others from your treatment. But if you have that same heart attack on an airplane, the flight may divert to land immediately to help save your life and incur tens of thousands of dollars in expense as a result. None of this is recoverable from the passenger\u2019s insurance, even though the airline is acting as an ambulance in this example. ", "For disruptive passengers, similar costs can be incurred if the plane must delay departure, land at another airport prematurely, or take other actions to deviate from the original flight plan. Recovering these costs which can include fuel, crew costs, other passenger disruption costs from missed connections, and more, could be substantial. If the airlines could make this legally stick, it also creates a pathway for the recovery of flight diversion costs not caused by disruptive passengers.", "The FAA maintains a \u201cno fly\u201d list for people who they deem could be dangerous to have on board. In addition, airlines individually can choose to ban customers from flying their airline, and this has been done for years. The federal list is a subset of the terrorist watch list, and was established after the attacks on 9/11/2001. This list has not been used to limit passengers from flying that refuse to wear a mask or cause an onboard altercation. ", "Delta has proposed that airlines share their individual lists,", " but Dombroff\u2019s idea to make this an FAA list makes more sense. It would mean an expansion of this original list idea, or the creation of a new FAA list to make this happen, but it it is very good idea. Behaving badly on one airline and not being able to fly on any airline for some period at least is a big-time consequence. Department of Transportation Secretary ", "Pete Buttigieg is considering this", ", too. ", "Collectively, these five initiatives would go a long way toward significantly reducing onboard disruptive acts by passengers. When most of these actions happen, they are spontaneous. Initially, even if all these initiatives were enacted, it might not stop the next rash of actions. But over a short time, the severe consequences that could include jail time, heavy fines, repayment of disruptive expenses, and public awareness of who did it, would likely bring this activity to a minimum. This would be a welcome set of actions to protect flight attendants, flight crews, and all the passengers that behave."]},

In the first few years a product exist, it\u2019s great if you don\u2019t have to let it out of your hands. Sell it to the customer and it\u2019s gone. If you act like Tesla, you can monitor it and update its software but you\u2019re much more divorced from it. Traditional car companies used to have almost nothing to do with the customer after the dealership bought the car. It\u2019s taking them some time to be more like Tesla. That\u2019s a problem when you are releasing a complex and entirely novel product. Just as software companies have mostly switched from selling you software on a CD to Software-as-a-service, the robotaxi model is so much easier.", "A robotaxi can be made that just services a special subset of the streets in just one town and it\u2019s still a real business. No car company will make a car that only works in one town or even just a few towns. They are used to selling products which work everywhere, both because private customers want it, and volume demands you be able to sell it as many places as you can.", "A robotaxi can be much more expensive to build than a private car. Add $10,000 to the cost of building your robotaxi and you can make it up with a modest increase in per-mile fees. $5,000 LIDAR? Not a problem. Add $10,000 to a consumer car and it\u2019s $25,000 more on the MSRP and it\u2019s a whole other class of car, and only in the luxury segment if it wasn\u2019t there to start. That\u2019s one reason Tesla is so motivated to make it all work with just cameras. In fact, when they started, there were no LIDARS they could have dreamed of putting on the car. (Today there are cheaper LIDARs but they are much more limited than the robotaxi models and used only for driver assist.)", "Cruise Origin vehicle concept", "Of course, the fact that the robotaxi only works in a few towns is a downside too. Building a robotaxi fleet is hugely capital intensive and uses a lot of human effort too. It\u2019s harder to grow it exponentially the way that Tesla sales have grown. You have to prep each city, build and maintain maps and much more. (Another reason Tesla is so keen to do without the maps.)

It was the speed, however, that drove the big valuations that made Amman want to take Cruise public. Investors are excited about turning the auto industry upside-down, and they want returns sooner rather than later. That\u2019s why they have driven the valuations of some companies through the roof. It\u2019s a part of why Tesla is more valuable than all the others put together.", "I was actually impressed and surprised at Cruise\u2019s devotion to the custom-designed Origin and the purer business plan. It was unusual for a car company subsidiary. It made me list GM as a leader. This is not to say it\u2019s dead \u2014 there is going to be a market for both robotaxis and other technologies for some years go come, even if, absent the dreams of Elon Musk, it takes longer to make a car you can sell to consumers.", "There is the outside chance, as well, that Elon\u2019s dreams come true. He\u2019s made a risky bet, that a breakthrough will come in computer vision that lets him turn a Tesla into a robotaxi with cheap hardware. If that breakthrough comes he\u2019ll be the even richer richest person and show up on more covers than Time magazine. If not, he\u2019ll still have a great position in innovative electric cars. He has a fantastic position if his bet pays off as well. As an automaker, Tesla plans to lease Teslas to customers, then buy them back at the end of 3 years and convert them to robotaxis. That\u2019s easy with the sleek interior of the Model 3 and Y \u2014 just pull out the wheel and pedals and put a wooden plate in the hole. Then he gets to supply his robotaxi fleet with 3 year old cars where customers ate almost half the depreciation cost. A 3 year old off-lease car with the wheel removed will make a very decent robotaxi. At this lower cost, he can undercut others on price, or just make more profits \u2014 if he gets his breakthrough."]},

In other words, she or he would first look for a convenient location.\u00a0Then, once in the store, the products have to look great, there has to be an adequate selection, and there has to be the ability to shop in store or take advantage of an on-line option as well. However, quality is also essential. The shopper today looks for trustworthy brands that give the shopper the highest quality products. The report also suggests that it has to be an ethical business that gives customers confidence in making purchase decisions.", "All of this means that a store cannot rely on a convenient location alone and must also deliver the shopping experience its customers seek. Essentially, the store has to care about the customer by constantly improving quality and service. In addition to caring about the customer, the store management should care about the associates as well, because their contentment reflects in better service to the customer. Associates who are happy with their job are more likely to show warmth and friendliness and project a more helpful attitude.", "Bottom line, stores that are easy to shop with trustworthy brands which reflect highest quality products are best positioned for success. Those stores that are constantly improving and give customers a feeling of care get the highest rating. ", "A deeper dive into the data shows that building customer loyalty is a bit complicated.

More than half of that was due to higher oil and gas prices, with hydrocarbons revenues up by around a third.

Reforms of subsidies on water and electricity have also been cautiously introduced, as part of a longer-term plan to cut subsidies by around two-thirds by 2025.", "Fitch expects the deficit to fall further to 1.6% of GDP in 2022, assuming an average oil price of $70 a barrel next year (the government\u2019s budget is based on $50 a barrel) as well as lower oil and gas capital spending and a further small decline in the cost of subsidies.", "Things may start to head in the opposite direction in 2023.

Thereafter, however, Fitch thinks the government\u2019s breakeven oil price (the price at which it can balance its budget) will be around $60 a barrel in 2024-25, even if the medium-term fiscal plan is not fully implemented.

{"header": "Why The Gold Standard Is Still The Best Option", "word": ["The historical record is clear: countries that have currencies based on gold tend to do very well. Those that don\u2019t, usually run into difficulties. The United States had a dollar based on gold (with some lapses) from 1789 to 1971, and became the wealthiest and most successful country in the world. Soon after the US gold standard era ended on August 15, 1971, someone asked the 31-year-old economist Arthur Laffer what he thought the outcome would be. \u201cIt won\u2019t be as much fun to be an American anymore,\u201d he reportedly said. Some people today still ask: \u201c", "WTF happened in 1971?", "\u201d Laffer had it all figured out.", "If you want to understand why things work out this way \u2014 why Arthur Laffer could make a prediction like that, and be right \u2014 you have to understand the principle of Stable Money. It\u2019s very simple: money is best when it is stable in value. It doesn\u2019t go up or down in value, as might be expressed in the foreign exchange market. Today, Turkey\u2019s currency, the lira, has been falling in value, and we generally look at this as a bad thing. Why is that? But, we don\u2019t want currencies to go up in value either. That would make debts harder and harder to repay, until eventually there was a wave of defaults. No fun. ", "The value of the US dollar, compared to gold, 1790-2021", "On a more subtle note, a stable currency is like a measuring-rod that doesn\u2019t change length. A stable \u201cmeasuring rod of value\u201d allows us to interact in the market economy effectively. The \u201cinformation\u201d contained in prices, which guide all aspects of the monetary economy, is not corrupted by changes in the currency itself. This idea was expertly elucidated by George Gilder in ", "The Scandal of Money ", "(2016).", "Or, as Arthur Laffer later said: \u201cMonetary policy\u2019s specific purpose should be to provide a stable valued currency both now and far into the future.\u201d", "The early economist David Ricardo said nearly the same thing in 1816: \u201cA currency, to be perfect, should be absolutely invariable in value.\u201d", "That is why most countries today have a simple stable-value policy. Usually, they link their currencies to the dollar or euro, either tightly or loosely. Sometimes, we may lament that they do not execute this policy with as much skill as we would like. But, that is nevertheless the basic idea. They learned that the effects of unstable money (like Turkey today) are bad enough that they should be avoided.", "Probably, you rarely hear any discussion about \u201cstable value\u201d as some kind of ideal, even though most countries in the world are doing it right now. The major central banks do not seem to hold this ideal at all. They aren\u2019t even trying to achieve stable value. Not surprisingly, they don\u2019t achieve it. ", "This has consequences", ".", "We live in an era of \u201cfloating fiat currencies.\u201d These currencies\u2019 values are supposed to go up and down, by design. Central banks never talk about fixing this problem. Instead, they talk about something else: manipulating the macroeconomy, through some kind of currency and interest rate distortion. This they talk about incessantly.", "The whole idea of a currency of stable value is that it is \u201cneutral:\u201d It does not distort commerce, like a meter or kilogram that doesn\u2019t change length or weight. The whole idea of a floating fiat currency is that it does distort commerce.", "All those countries that link their currencies to the dollar or euro are effectively giving up \u201cfloating fiat currencies.\u201d Their currencies don\u2019t float, they are fixed in value, to an external benchmark of value, the dollar or euro. Thus, they are depoliticized.", "A gold standard is the same idea. Currencies\u2019 values are linked to gold, an external standard of value. We do not assume that gold is a perfectly unchanging measure of this ideal of \u201cstable value.\u201d But, after centuries (actually millennia) of experience in these matters, we have determined two things.", "1) It is good enough. Whatever variation gold may have, against this ideal of Stable Value, has not been large enough to matter very much. It works very well.", "2) There is no better alternative. Nobody has found some measure of \u201cstable value\u201d that is superior to gold.", "Gold also has what we might call political advantages. Let\u2019s say that a bunch of eggheads at the Federal Reserve came up with some statistical concoction that they claim is even more stable in value than gold. This has never happened, in part because they don\u2019t even try. Let\u2019s make-believe that it is not impossible \u2014 although it looks impossible \u2014 but actually happened. Then what?", "This statistical concoction, no matter how wonderful it was, would immediately be subject to political pressures. One way or another, there would be attempts to somehow adjust the outcome to affect the macroeconomy \u2014 before an election, for example. If you look at the continuous stream of revisions of the Consumer Price Index that have taken place, it is hard to imagine any statistical concoction that wouldn\u2019t be subject to a similar continuous process of revision, to serve a continual series of agendas.", "Second, other countries would be hesitant to adopt this. They would be, in effect, declaring a sort of political allegiance, which could be risky, as we have seen in the eurozone. Gold is the one standard that everyone has been able to agree on, in the past, because it is not the property of any one government.", "It is easy to see why today\u2019s most popular cryptocurrencies can\u2019t serve as a measure of Stable Value. Their values are not stable at all, but fluctuate wildly. However, you could certainly include today\u2019s crypto innovations ", "into your gold standard system", ".

We made money out of gold, because gold best approaches what we want money to be \u2014 stable in value. You can see this, because we assume that money is stable in value, even when we know that it is not. For example, when the price of oil goes from $70 to $80, we assume that the value of oil went up 14%, as measured in a money of stable value. We do not assume that the value of the currency fell 13%, while oil remained stable, although that might be what actually happened.

Even the instant oatmeal packets contained a whopping 20 grams of sugar. For Thompson, this experience of working in an intense, fast-paced environment for long hours shed light on the difficulty of eating well in modern-day America. She decided to commercialize something she had created as a hack as a kid: oatmeal soaked overnight in milk.\u00a0", "Thompson began selling handmade batches of naturally gluten-free, protein-rich, vegan overnight oats made with plant-based milk and sweetened only by dates for zero added sugar at farmer\u2019s markets in San Diego.

With five kids, her working parents had scarce resources. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t poverty, but it was close,\u201d Thompson says. So, she grew up eating a ton of cereal. As a teenager, her older sister was diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes. Various other family members suffered both physical and mental health issues. This made Thompson curious as to the connection between what we eat and how we feel.

Her oats are refrigerated and have no preservatives or artificial ingredients, so scaling was particularly difficult. But overall, Thompson has found that part of the journey enjoyable. \u201cIt\u2019s tough but fun to solve those kinds of problems,\u201d she says.

Whether they know the statistics and press releases or not, they cannot miss reality. But in another sense, this media interpretation stands to reason. Accusing the public of ignorance makes the writer feel superior and, as the saying goes, \u201cin the know.\u201d Perhaps there is a better explanation for this difference between polls and the statistical picture:\u00a0\u00a0the data looks back, while the public is looking forward.", "To be sure, Americans are pessimistic about economic prospects, and have become more so in just the last few months.

The Gallop index of public confidence recently registered a value of -25, a huge difference from last spring\u2019s positive reading. Some 40% of Americans say that this is a bad time to buy a home, the highest percentage since the early 1980s, when inflation was running high, and the economy was in recession.", "And as the journalists point out, the data does look good.

Unemployment as a percent of the workforce has dropped from 6.7% a year ago to 4.2% in November. Hourly earnings have risen at almost a 5% annual rate, a pace not seen in years. New home sales have jumped 7.5% in just the last two months. Orders at manufacturers have risen some 22% from year ago levels, and lists of unfilled orders continue to expand, pointing to more activity immediately ahead. American checking accounts, according to the Federal Reserve (Fed), have risen some 50% from year-ago levels, while household net worth has risen by a like amount since the early days of the pandemic.", "People can see these immediate positives.

Not unreasonably, people fear that it might spark a new round of lockdowns and quarantines. It has already halted much international travel. The average American has also learned in the past couple of years that politics in Washington and state capitals could impel such lockdowns and quarantines even if the new variant does not require them.", "And then there is inflation. For months, as prices generally, but especially for groceries and gasoline, have soared, Washington dismissed the pain as \u201ctransitory.\u201d While official Washington remained insouciant, people saw the cost of living outpace even robust wage gains so that most found themselves worse off than they were a year ago. And because the most severe price increases have occurred among essentials, the hardship has fallen most on the least well off in society. The average American certainly is not ignorant of these economic facts.", "Still more capable of creating public concern are uncertainties about policy responses to the inflation. Since Washington now has admitted that the \u201ctransitory\u201d description was misplaced, people know that some change in policy is likely. The Fed has already announced a gradual end to its practice of putting money into the economy through direct purchases of bonds on financial markets, what the Fed calls \u201cquantitative easing.\u201d If the inflation remains persistent, interest rate hikes will follow. The average Joe or Jane may not quote easily from economic theory, but he or she can sense the direction of things and how the turn in Fed policy will make credit scarcer, make bank loans and mortgages more expensive, and accordingly restrain economic growth. People are also aware that even as President Biden\u2019s \u201cBuild Back Better\u201d bill waits on a vote in Congress, the inflation will demand for less expansive and generous fiscal measures from here on out.", "From this perspective, the average American appears less ignorant and perhaps somewhat more insightful than the condescending explanations offered by some \u2013 though not all \u2013 media outlets. There is, as a consequence, no contradiction between the flow of statistics and people\u2019s attitudes about the economy.\u00a0\u00a0People are well aware that things are going well enough, for now. They also know that further out on the time horizon prospects look a lot more problematic.
